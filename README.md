# crossword

Introduction

In this project we have to create an AI to fill the crossword blocks using backtracking. For this we need implement some ideas regarding optimization over a large_dataset.In this project the following ideas were implemented:
1. Node consistancy
2. Arc consistancy
3. Backtracking search

Setting Up

1. Clone Repository
2. The project contains assets(for image_generation), data_file(contains structure i.e. crossword puzzle, the possible words that we need to fill **should be of different size), crossword.py, generate.py.
3. Now enter:
             "python3 generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png"
4. We can try different possible combinations of structures and words.
5. After entering the above command we get an image of filled crossword puzzle.
